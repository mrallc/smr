simple mapreduce: inspired by hadoop and cloud mapreduce; aims to be
significantly more robust, simpler, and faster (to the extent that
streaming data from S3 is not a bottleneck).

instructions:

1. clone this repository as "git clone git@github.com:mrallc/smr.git"

2. "cd smr"

3. "./init.sh"

4. import existing projects into eclipse from the smr top-level
directory
